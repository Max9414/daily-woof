# Daily Woof

## Introduction

Welcome to Daily Woof, a website completely dedicated to your bestfriends, with clear and useful pages for both new and expert dog owners.

The project aims to create a website where people can connect, learn more about dogs and create events to enjoy unique days with new people and new dogs, still keeping the connections a bit less personal and casual.
